## About Me
I used to run a cake business, but I’ve always loved computers. I thought programming wasn’t for me — until my son encouraged me to try, no matter my age.  
Now, after a year of learning, I build user-friendly websites combining creativity and code. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
